Developing
==============

Very easy thanks to Cargo

1. Install Rust and Cargo (nightlies)

2. Install libtcod: http://doryen.eptalys.net/data/libtcod/doc/1.5.2/html2/compile_libtcod.html?c=false&cpp=false&cs=false&py=false&lua=false

3. Clone the repo

  > git clone https://github.com/GeckoTheGeek42/Ascii-Games-and-Stuff.git
  
  > cd Ascii-Games-and-Stuff/
  
4. Then just build and run (in the directory you cloned to):
  
  > cargo build
  
  > cargo run
  
Notes: you may have to alter the build.sh to to wherever you installed and compiled libtcod
